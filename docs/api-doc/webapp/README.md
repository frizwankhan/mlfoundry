MLFoundry allows you to build a custom demo of your models where users can enter new data points and see the output of your model. They can also log feedback for you to see. This demo could be used by

* Share your work with the broader team.
* Get feedback from Product Managers & Business Owners.
* Show demo to customers in the early stage of development by customer success and Sales team.

This solution combines -

* Diversity of [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) where you can work with any type of models including image, text & structured.
* Simplicity of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) where you can add any custom functionalities and be in control of your app.
* Versatility of [Truefoundry](https://truefoundry.gitbook.io/) which allows you to package and deploy your entire model without worrying about dependencies, artifacts and frameworks.
