# Overview

## What is MLFoundry



MLFoundry is a client library to allow users to log their experiments, models, metrics, data, features which are fed to TrueFoundryâ€™s monitoring systems to generate informative dashboards and insights.

TrueFoundry is building an end-to-end MLOps CoPilot where we combine the best-in-breed solutions, fill in the gaps and provide users a unified coherent tech stack.

For monitoring, specifically-

* We present a unified API that combines the benefits of [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org), [WhyLabs](https://whylabs.ai) along with our proprietary algorithms.
* Full monitoring and observability solution for your data, features, models & system.
* Access to hosted dashboards that have different views for technical and business users.
* Integration with other parts of our MLOps CoPilot which allows to train, deploy & scale your ML models.

Using MLFoundry you can create multiple experiments and each experiments can have multiple loggers.
