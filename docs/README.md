# Overview

## What is MLFoundry



MLFoundry is TrueFoundry's ML Monitoring & Experiment Tracking solution. It is a client-side library that allow users to log their experiments, models, metrics, data & features. This data is fed to TrueFoundryâ€™s monitoring systems to generate informative dashboards and insights. Specifically-

* We present a unified API that combines the benefits of [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org) (which allows you to track your experiments), [WhyLabs](https://whylabs.ai) (which enables observability through data summarisation), [Evidently]((https://evidentlyai.com)) (which enables drift and model health monitoring) along with our proprietary algorithms.
* Full monitoring and observability solution for your data, features, models & system rendered on an app built on top of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).
* Access to hosted dashboards that have different views for technical and business users.
* Integration with other parts of our MLOps CoPilot which allows to train, deploy & scale your ML models.

At a high level, TrueFoundry is building the very first [ML Workflow Stores- your MLOps CoPilot](https://medium.com/@nikunjbajaj/times-strategy-is-divide-conquer-386a7ae319d1). Our goal is to break the [artificial boundaries between people, process and tools](https://medium.com/@nikunjbajaj/times-strategy-is-divide-conquer-386a7ae319d1) that exists throughout the ML development lifecycle. We are building an opinionated platform, which allows you organize your  ML development into workflows and is built on top of existing open source tools. We take away the [mental overhead](https://medium.com/@nikunjbajaj/time-killed-my-ml-model-48521fad6c4) of choosing the right tools and figure out their interoperability so you can get a cohesive yet modular stack. The motto is-
